# Project Plan

## Title
Comparative Analysis of Registered Trees in Cologne and Frankfurt (2020)

## Summary and Rationale
The project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the number of registered trees in Cologne and Frankfurt for the year 2020. Understanding the differences and
similarities in tree populations between these two cities can provide valuable insights into urban forestry and environmental management. This analysis will
utilize data from two distinct datasets, one for Cologne and another for Frankfurt.
The project will employ data science methodologies and statistical techniques to explore and visualize the tree data. By examining factors such as tree species
distribution, Age distribution, Trunk diameter distribution, Height distribution, and geographic distribution, the project aims to answer the main question regarding the comparative tree populations.

## Main Questions
1. What is the distribution of age of trees in the region of Colonge and Frankfurt for the year 2020?
2. What is the distribution of height of trees in the region of Colonge and Frankfurt for the year 2020?
3. What is the distribution of trunk diameter of trees in the region of Colonge and Frankfurt for the year 2020?
4. Analyses of type of trees in the region of Cologne and Frankfurt for the year 2020.
5. Geographical visualization of Registers tree in both regions for the year 2020?
6. What the density of trees per square km in both the region?

## Datasources
